Multi-Step Reasoning Module
5.1 Beyond Reflex: Multi-Step Reasoning

Learn how AI agents can perform reasoning over multiple steps, rather than reacting with a single action. Focus is on planning, decision-making, and chaining actions logically.

5.2 ReAct Model: Reason → Act → Observe → Think

Explore the ReAct framework, where agents:

Reason about the problem

Act on it

Observe the results

Reflect to plan the next step

This iterative cycle enables smarter, context-aware AI behavior.

5.3 Planner-Executor Model

Understand the Planner-Executor architecture:

Planner: decides the steps to reach a goal

Executor: carries out the steps
This separation improves modularity and clarity in AI workflows.

5.4 Task Decomposition & Chain of Thought Design

Learn how to:

Break complex tasks into smaller steps

Design reasoning chains that feed outputs of one step into the next

Build structured workflows for agents to solve complicated problems

5.5 Introduction to LangGraph / Semantic Kernel Planners

LangGraph: represent reasoning workflows as graphs of nodes and edges, where each node can perform a task and pass results to the next

Semantic Kernel Planners: conceptually plan multi-step actions from a goal, producing a sequence of steps for agents to execute

This section bridges conceptual planning with practical execution, preparing agents for complex, multi-step reasoning.
